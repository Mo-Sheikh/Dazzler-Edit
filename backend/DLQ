1 - have a cloudwatch alarm triggered on CPU
2 - when this alarm CLEARs trigger a lambda
3 - the lambda reads all the messages currently in the queue into a map of entity/pid/upsert|delete
4 - for each item in the map it sends a synthesised S3 event to the WS-Appw-Input topic

The result of this is that any updates that got missed will be re-triggered but with the latest values.

Note - we don't need to read the message bodies - all the information we need is in the message attributes.
